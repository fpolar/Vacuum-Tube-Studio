TODO
-------------------
- check new user clear

- use just orientation and thick or thin mode to paint from user in one spot

- double check my cloning of the player dom doesnt create problems with its id

- pictionary meets heads up
- make submit button so guesser can choose to give points to multiple people
- big reveal of word animating towards screen(getting bigger) and fading out
- when two players draw at the same time it flips out
- for now, a simple timeout works fairly well, but a round counter could 
  synchronize more cleanly in updategameclient
- see if i can remove the player_state parameter from setupround in myroom.ts

- add a button to allow user to save canvas as png (only fire once)
`var image = canvas.toDataURL("image/png").replace("image/png", "image/octet-stream"); 
window.location.href=image;`

- If I make this into a BR, I'm going to have to find a new way to store the word
  or else people could cheat easily with the console

- Users who enter later, risize, or refresh page cannot see the drawings on their client, even
if they're in a spot on the canvas where they should be able to.
  - maybe keep track of all 'dots' drawn so they can be redrawn on join?
  - related to below note

- Tilt controls can feel a little awkward because of the small space u can move using it
  - finesse the values to make it feel tighter

- after a few draws or after some condition is met, show tips on mobile
  - like a message that tells the user to hit their emoji to move their position on the canvas

- better tool bar to the client side
  - size slider
  - change emoji/color(most likely not let them select, just a randomization button)

- try removing all jquery, it may be unnecessary

- use let instead of var when the scope allows
